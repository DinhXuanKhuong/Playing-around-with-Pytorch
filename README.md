# Playing Around with PyTorch

This repository documents my journey as I learn and explore deep learning concepts, following the "Dive into Deep Learning" course. Here, I experiment with PyTorch, implement various models, and share my progress, notes, and code examples.

## About

This project is a personal learning log as I work through the "Dive into Deep Learning" course. My goals are to:

- Understand the fundamentals of deep learning
- Gain hands-on experience with PyTorch
- Build and experiment with neural networks
- Document my learning process and share useful resources

## Structure

The repository will include:

- Notebooks and scripts for each chapter or concept
- Notes and summaries of key ideas
- Experiment results and observations
